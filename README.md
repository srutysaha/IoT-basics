# IoT-Basics Repository

This repository consists of IoT basic projects. All projects are in the form of Challenges.



## Challenges

 ### Challenge1-LEDAlt
In this project there are 2 LED lights that blink one after the other-alternatively,continuously.Things Required:
  - Arduino UNO
  - Jumper Wires
  - BreadBoard
  - 2 LEDs
### Challenge2-CloudTransfer
In this project there is a DHT11 sensor which senses the humidity and temperature of the place and sends the real time data to ThingSpeak server using NodeMCU. The data is then represented in the form of chart.Things Required:
  - NodeMCU
  - Jumper Wires
  - BreadBoard
  - DHT11 sensor
